This program multiplies large integers from user input
through Karatsuba's multiplication algorithm.

To feed a file as input from the command line enter the file
name(s) as program arguments. I've included a file with various 
test cases called "1TestCase.txt" in the cmake-build-debug folder.
To use this test case on the program enter in command line:

.\HW1.exe 1TestCase.txt

Otherwise enter 2 values as input.
